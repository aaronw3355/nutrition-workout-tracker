Description:

The nutrition workout tracker is an early development of a much larger  web app. The app will allow you to track, log, and revist past calorie intakes along with workouts. This project was designed for a Python College course. I plan on continuing this after the course as I would like to create a design where friends and family can compete to accomplish workout and nutrition goals.
