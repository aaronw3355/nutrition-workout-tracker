# nutrition-workout-tracker

Description:

The nutrition workout tracker is an early development of a much larger  web app. The app will allow you to track, log, and revist past calorie intakes along with workouts. This project was designed for a Python College course. I plan on continuing this after the course as I would like to create a design where friends and family can compete to accomplish workout and nutrition goals.
The program will allow users to log meals along with all the nutritional information. The user will be able to be very specific adding calories, protein, and carbohydrates. The user will also be able to track workout sessions. There will be functions to allow the user to log calories burned, exercise name, and how long the workout was. Outside of those function the user will be able to do more. For calorie tracking the user will be able to set daily calorie goals that you can see adjust as you input want you consumed and burned. As the program grows you will be able to share and compete with friends within the web app.
All of the data will be saved onto JSON files. This will ensure that users will be able to close and open to continue tracking the data while not losing any data. The program will have different functions for saving data, uploading meals, upload nutrition intake, and summaries.
The main menu will be simple and easy to use. The user will have four options on the main menu screen. Will start with a summarized overview of the current day. Then an option for input of all nutrients. An additional option for input of workout information. Then a final option to access challenges. Which will later feature a challenge with friends option.

Files found in project
**TermProject.py** : This is the main Python script that will contain all of the functions I want and the main menu.
**meals.json**: Will store all the meal and nutrition data in JSON Format.
**workout.json**: Stores all workout and exercise informationm data in JSON format.
**calorie_goal.json** Will store and track all the calorie information. Including input/ouput and goals.

Future improvements will come in wave. I will have a long term improvement goal of making is an app that could be shared and used within groups. On our way to that goal we will send frequent satisfaction surveys to plan and develop progress. With this information we will be able to successfully build the program with our users in mind.
